# GameDevSecretSauce

This repository is dedicated for storing useful Unity scripts and resoources that I came across. Feel free to use it in your games/projects! 
The repo itself is not structured as a Unity project but as a portal to each topic. You can find out more about each topic from the README.md file of each sub directory.

## Table of Contents
