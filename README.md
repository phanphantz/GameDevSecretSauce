# GameDevSecretSauce

This repository is dedicated to storing useful Unity scripts and resources I came across. Feel free to use it in your games/projects! 
The repo itself is not structured as a Unity project but as a portal to each topic, so that you can quickly grab and use them in your project right away.
You can learn more about each topic from the README.md file of each sub-directory.
